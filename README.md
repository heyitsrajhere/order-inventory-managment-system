# 🎯 Inventory Order Flow Management — Task (API creation with order item status logics)

# 🎯 Project Overview

* The project is a rental management system consisting of separate user and admin panels. Admins are responsible for adding inventories, each identified with a unique barcode, which are displayed to users as artworks. Users can create multiple orders with defined pickup and return dates, and add inventories to these orders similar to a cart functionality, ensuring no duplicate inventories exist within the same order. Once users finalize their selections, they can request a hold for that order. The system allows a maximum of three hold requests for the same inventory across conflicting dates; any further requests mark the inventory as unavailable. Admins then review and confirm orders based on a first-come, first-served approach. When an order is confirmed, all inventories under that order become unavailable to other users until the order’s return date.  
    
* After a user requests a hold on an order, the admin reviews and approves the items individually. Only items with hold-request statuses can be approved: on-hold-request items become on-hold, second-hold-request items become second-hold, and third-hold-request items become third-hold. Items with any other status are not eligible for approval.

## ✅ Task Scope & Requirements
- [ ] Use provided sample JSON data (inventories, users, orders, order items)
- [ ] Implement status management logic for these APIs:
  - [ ] **/request-hold** – Update inventory statuses on user hold requests; respect conflicts and hold limits
  - [ ] **/remove-order-item** – Recalculate statuses when an inventory is removed; update conflicting orders
  - [ ] **/update-order** – Update statuses when admin changes pickup/return dates; prevent conflicts with confirmed orders
  - [ ] **/confirm-order** – Validate availability and conflicts before confirming; update statuses of all affected inventories

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All four API flows (/request-hold, /remove-order-item, /update-order, /confirm-order) implemented correctly
- [ ] Order item and order statuses update accurately based on conflicts
- [ ] Order update API prevents modification when conflicts exist with confirmed orders
- [ ] Order confirmation validates availability and conflicts before finalizing
- [ ] Removing an order item correctly updates or restores related statuses in other orders
- [ ] Conflict detection and status recalculation logic is modular, reusable, and tested
- [ ] Code follows folder naming conventions, file length limit, and structure rules
- [ ] Adequate error handling and logging added for debugging

## 🚀 Delivery
- [ ] Create a **private GitHub repo** and share access with: **pratik@saeculumsolutions.com**, **malhar.prajapati@saeculumsolutions.com**
- [ ] Or create a **public repo** and share the URL

## API Overview and Testing

### Implemented Flows
- Create order: `POST /orders`
- Request Hold: `PUT /orders/request-hold/:order_id`
- Remove Order Item: `DELETE /order-items/remove-order-item/:oi_id`
- Update Order Dates: `PUT /orders/update-order/:order_id`
- Confirm Order: `PUT /orders/confirm-order/:order_id`
- Admin: List Hold Requests: `GET /orders/hold-requests`
- Admin: Approve/Reject Hold: `PUT /orders/approve-hold/:oi_id`

### Postman Collection
Import the collection to quickly test all endpoints:
- File: `postman/inventory.postman_collection.json`

### Seeding Sample Data (PowerShell)
Run these from project root to import provided JSONs into MongoDB `node-practical`:

```powershell
mongoimport --db node-practical --collection users --file ".\src\json-data\user.json" --jsonArray
mongoimport --db node-practical --collection inventories --file ".\src\json-data\inventory.json" --jsonArray
mongoimport --db node-practical --collection orders --file ".\src\json-data\order.json" --jsonArray
mongoimport --db node-practical --collection orderitems --file ".\src\json-data\order-item.json" --jsonArray
```

## Notes
- Uses MongoDB on `mongodb://localhost:27017/node-practical`
- Dates are processed as ISO strings (UTC). Ensure inputs are ISO-8601.
- npm start and start test with mentioned route in postman
